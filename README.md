# SimpleWriter
This is a simple application I made to assist me with my writing by providing an informative, yet simple, user interface.

## Features
### Simple User Interface
The program provides a simple user interface.  A dark theme was chosen so that it is easy on the eyes and can be used for an extended period of time.

### Instant information
The word count is visible in the top right corner and is updated live providing useful information to the user while they are typing.

### Simple menu
In the left there is a simple menu that lets a user create a new text file and write, open an existing text file and save the text file that is currently open.

### Always save
The application requires the user to save a text file before they can start writing, ensuring that the user can always save without ever having to disrupt their writing.

### Easy to save
The application shows you if all the changes have been saved in the menu.  It also lets you save using the Ctrl+S shortcut so you don't get distracted from what you're writing.

### Spelling checker
The application will check your spelling as you type and suggestions can be given if there is a mistake.
